# Guitar Templates

The projects included in this repository are a collection of electric guitar templates that I have created. 

Some are my original designs and some are recreations of vintage guitars. The recreations are based on personal research and photographs of the originals to try and create the most accurate templates posible.

I don't make money from these templates as building guitars is just a hobby so you are more than welcome to use them. 

If you like what I've created and you would like to use them please consider buying me a coffee https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pipthepilot
