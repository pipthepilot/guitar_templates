# Fender Telecaster

The Fender Telecaster is my favourite Guitar and is a great first guitar for amateur luthiers to build.

Creating these templates took a lot of research and time to draft as I have tried to create them as historically accurate as I possibly could. 

If you like what I've created and you would like to use them, you are more than welcome, but please consider buying me a coffee https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pipthepilot
